# Appendix — The study: the harnesses evaluated

This appendix **shows the work**: the full list of harnesses that went through the study, with **where they came from** (upstream repository), **the exact snapshot that was read** (fork/commit/snapshot — the materialization of the method's cutoff date, ch. 01 §6) and the link to the **complete evaluation** of each one. The instrument used in every evaluation is the same: the [`HARNESS_EVAL.md`](https://github.com/GHDaru/harness_engineering/blob/main/benchmark/template/HARNESS_EVAL.md) template (and [`FRAMEWORK_EVAL.md`](https://github.com/GHDaru/harness_engineering/blob/main/benchmark/template/FRAMEWORK_EVAL.md) for frameworks), applied through systematic code reading following the [benchmark methodology](https://github.com/GHDaru/harness_engineering/blob/main/benchmark/README.md) (in Portuguese).

## How to read this table

- **Origin**: the public upstream repository.
- **Version/snapshot**: the version or snapshot that was read.
- **Fork/commit (cutoff date)**: the picture frozen in the `GHDaru/*` fork — this is what guarantees **reproducibility** (anyone can read the same commit) and materializes the method's obsolescence mitigation. The forks are synchronized by the [`scripts/sync-forks.ps1`](https://github.com/GHDaru/harness_engineering/blob/main/scripts/sync-forks.ps1) script.
- **Evaluation**: the complete document (metadata, per-dimension scores with code evidence, diagnosis and "what to steal").

## Extension ext-1 (2026-07-31): the first Radar→corpus promotion

The corpus grew from 16 to **18** through the very path the book itself institutionalized: the [daily Radar](https://github.com/GHDaru/harness_engineering/blob/main/radar/RADAR.md) (in Portuguese) found the candidates (2026-07-31 sweep), the editor approved the promotion, the repositories were forked for frozen reading, and the same instrument (`HARNESS_EVAL.md`) was applied — round **ext-1**, without touching the round 1/2 snapshots. Both pass the inclusion test of ch. 01 §4 (open source + general-purpose harness + adoption/representativeness): Grok Build for the opening of a complete commercial harness; Pi as a **deliberately atypical case** (Yin's replication logic called for a minimalist counterpoint, and the corpus was missing one).

| Harness | Category | Origin | Version/snapshot | Fork/commit read | Evaluated on | Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Grok Build (xAI)** | coding harnesses | [github.com/xai-org/grok-build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) | snapshot 2026-07 (opened on 2026-07-15, Apache 2.0) | fork GHDaru/grok-build, commit dd04f39 | 2026-07-31 (round ext-1) | [evaluation](../../benchmark/avaliacoes/grok-build.html) |
| **Pi (Earendil Labs)** | coding harnesses | [github.com/badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) | snapshot 2026-07-31 | fork GHDaru/pi, commit 7846534 | 2026-07-31 (round ext-1) | [evaluation](../../benchmark/avaliacoes/pi.html) |

## Extension ext-2 (2026-08-02): the second promotion — and a new category

The corpus grew from 18 to **20** through the same path: the Radar confirmed QM in a primary source (2026-08-02 sweep) and the critical reading of a vendor marketing article led to Kimi Code, verified at the source; the editor approved, the repositories were forked and the instrument applied — round **ext-2**. Kimi Code enters under the same criterion as Grok Build (the second model vendor opening a complete harness — the pattern became a trend, ch. 14). QM did not fit any existing archetype and **inaugurates the "organizational agents" category**: the unit of design is the organization (scopes, audience-based permissions, consent, auditing), and the agent loop is a swappable engine — indeed, **Pi itself, evaluated in ext-1, is a dependency here** (`package.json`). Yin's replication logic called for exactly this: a case that would test the limits of the taxonomy.

| Harness | Category | Origin | Version/snapshot | Fork/commit read | Evaluated on | Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Kimi Code (Moonshot AI)** | coding harnesses | [github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code) | CLI 0.31.1 (opened ~2026-06, MIT) | fork GHDaru/kimi-code, commit e22479a | 2026-08-02 (round ext-2) | [evaluation](../../benchmark/avaliacoes/kimi-code.html) |
| **QM (Y Combinator)** | organizational agents | [github.com/yc-software/qm](https://github.com/yc-software/qm) | snapshot 2026-07-31 (opened on 2026-07-31, MIT) | fork GHDaru/qm, commit 7f2c916 | 2026-08-02 (round ext-2) | [evaluation](../../benchmark/avaliacoes/qm.html) |

## Extension ext-3 (2026-08-02): evaluated and **not included** — the inclusion test at work

The method documents refusals too. **Traycer** (Traycer AI) was nominated by the editor, forked and evaluated with the full instrument (fork GHDaru/traycer, commit `65fc3d7`, MIT) — and **did not pass the inclusion test** of ch. 01 §4: the open repository (~513k lines) contains clients, a CLI and a remarkable orchestration protocol, but **none of the four harness pieces** — the Host that runs loop, context, tools and control is a signed closed binary with a mandatory cloud (the repo's own `AGENTS.md` states the Host and backends are not there). The [full evaluation](../../benchmark/avaliacoes/traycer.html) (18/36) stays on record: it is the study's best-documented case of "open source" as a client-distribution strategy, and the central evidence of the new [Appendix — The supply chain](appendix-supply-chain.md), for which the reading yielded the map of 18 orchestrated harnesses.

## Consolidated diagnosis

The **per-dimension results** (scores 0–3, with evidence) and the comparative diagnosis live in the [Harness Comparison](comparative.html) — including the interactive heatmap. Beyond the scores, each individual evaluation brings: the harness's **observed archetype**, its strengths with file paths, and the **"what to steal"** section (patterns worth carrying over to other harnesses).

> **Method note** (ch. 01 §6): selection followed replication logic (Yin) — representative *and* deliberately atypical cases; the unit of analysis is the source code; the scores follow the template's fixed grid (feature analysis, DESMET). The expiration scoreboard for the predictions is in the [History](../historico.html) (in Portuguese).
